# Abstract

NatureMap is a web-based GIS application designed to help users log and visualize their visits to local parks and green spaces. Using the Esri.js API, users can mark parks they have previously visited, bookmark parks to visit in the future, and write personalized notes for each site. Informational pop-ups provide key details about each green space, helping users make informed decisions about where to explore next.

By allowing users to track and organize their visits, NatureMap promotes stronger outdoor engagement and environmental awareness. Informational pop-ups ensure users have access to essential details about each location, improving decision-making for recreational outings. The bookmarking and visit tracking features simplify planning future visits and discovering new parks. Notetaking enables users to reflect on their experiences, noting what they enjoyed or why they might not revisit a park. As a personal organizational tool, NatureMap helps individuals engage with nature in meaningful and personalized ways.
